6. XAlign - https://github.com/qfish/XAlign
An amazing Xcode plugin to align regular code. it can align Xnything in any way you want.

7. MCLog - https://github.com/yuhua-chen/MCLog
This plugin lets you easily filter the Xcode console log output. While you can already search the text in the console log output you are still left searching through a lot of code that has nothing to do with what you're interested in. MCLog is a simple solution to this problem. Filter the console using simple strings and display what you really want to see.

Will be using in the near future:

1. VVDocumenter-Xcode - https://github.com/onevcat/VVDocumenter-Xcode
