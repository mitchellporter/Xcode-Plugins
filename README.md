# Xcode-Plugins
Currently using:

1. SCXcodeSwitchExpander - https://github.com/stefanceriu/SCXcodeSwitchExpander
Autocompletion for switch statements. Will autocomplete all possible cases for enums.

2. BBUDebuggerTuckAway - https://github.com/neonichu/BBUDebuggerTuckAway
Xcode plugin for auto-hiding the debugger once you start typing in the source code editor.

Will be using in the near future:

1. VVDocumenter-Xcode - https://github.com/onevcat/VVDocumenter-Xcode
Xcode plug-in which helps you write documentation comments easier, for both Objective-C and Swift.

2. ColorSense-for-Xcode - https://github.com/omz/ColorSense-for-Xcode
Not working for me right now on Xcode 7
